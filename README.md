Barebones Web Based Bingo Number Calling System (HTML/CSS/JS)

A simple barebones template that randomly calls bingo numbers and populates a table to show which numbers have been called
Based on 90 ball UK bingo

**ToDo:**
- make table of called numbers display properly on mobile devices in portrait mode (stop using <TABLE> for layout)
- last called number should be different colour to other called numbers
- build an auto calling feature so that numbers are called automatically ever _n_ seconds.
- config.php - friendly front end to edit the game parameters (auto call on/off, speed of number calls, audio on/off, 
- better audio (non syntheitc speech)
- proper bingo number calling (two little ducks, legs eleven, unlucky for some etc)
- better looking numbers/balls
- POSSIBLE: bingo card generetor
  - make it interactive... or even autofill... requires some sort of microservice to get numbers and feedback if they've won.
